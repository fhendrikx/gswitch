## Introduction ##

Gswitch automatically changes your GNOME desktop background every so often. The backgrounds are displayed randomly. All background images and style settings are sourced from your list of backgrounds as configured in _System > Preferences > Appearance_. By default, images are switched after 20 minutes. Although the images are shown randomly, every image will be shown at least once before you see any repeats.

Gswitch was originally written for my own needs. It is provided to you in the hope that it might be useful. **Feel free to drop me a line if you have any suggestions, problems or patches.**
