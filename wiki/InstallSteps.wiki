=== Step 3 ===
Type the following into the appropriate boxes, as detailed below:
  * Name: Gswitch
  * Command: /usr/bin/gswitch -t 30

*Please note that if you want your background to change more or less frequently, you should adjust the "30" to the number of minutes you want. For example, if you want the desktop background to change only once per hour, put 60 here. Likewise, if you want it to change every quarter hour, put 15.*
